        The Office is one of the most well-known TV shows in the states. I've watched the series since I was in middle school.
        It's very popular, and it comes up in conversation from time to time. In a lot of conversations, I'd hear things like
        "Oh the show get so much worse when Micheal leaves!"
        It occurred to me that that can be measured, so thought it might be fun to take a look at the series from an analytical standpoint.
